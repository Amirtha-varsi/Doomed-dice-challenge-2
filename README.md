You were happily spending a lazy afternoon playing your board game with your dice when suddenly, the mischievous Norse God Loki appeared.

Since you love Thor too much (and Loki didnâ€™t like that), he decided to curse your dice for fun. He removed all the "spots" from the dice, making them completely blank.

No problem! You have the tools to re-attach the spots back onto the dice.

However, Loki has doomed your dice with the following conditions:

Die A cannot have more than 4 spots on any face.
Die A may have multiple faces with the same number of spots.
Die B can have as many spots on a face as necessary (even more than 6).
The probability of obtaining each possible sum must remain the same.
That means if the original dice had a probability of rolling Sum = 2 as 1/X, then the new dice must be modified in such a way that these probabilities do not change.

A transformation function undoom_dice(Die_A, Die_B) that takes (Die_A, Die_B) as input and outputs:

Edit
New_Die_A = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]  
New_Die_B = [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]  
where:

No face of New_Die_A should have more than 4 spots.
New_Die_B should compensate for this constraint while maintaining the same sum probabilities.
Now the question is properly formatted and easy to understand! Let me know if you need any modifications. ðŸ˜Š








Solution to Part B: The Doomed Dice Challenge
We need to transform Die_A and Die_B such that:

Die_A has at most 4 spots on any face.
Die_B is adjusted to maintain the same probability distribution for all possible sums.
Approach
Calculate the original sum probabilities using the standard dice [1,2,3,4,5,6] for both Die_A and Die_B.
Transform Die_A so that no face has more than 4 spots.
Adjust Die_B to ensure that the new dice still produce the same sum probabilities as the original.
Mathematical Adjustment
Step 1: Probability of Sums with Original Dice
Each die has faces [1,2,3,4,5,6], so we calculate the probability of each sum (from 2 to 12).

For example:

Sum = 2 occurs in 1 way: (1,1), so probability = 1/36
Sum = 3 occurs in 2 ways: (1,2), (2,1), so probability = 2/36
Sum = 4 occurs in 3 ways: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), so probability = 3/36
â€¦ and so on.
Step 2: Modify Die_A
We replace [1,2,3,4,5,6] with values that do not exceed 4.
A possible transformation is:



New_Die_A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
Step 3: Adjust Die_B to Maintain Probabilities
Since we reduced values in Die_A, Die_B must compensate to keep the same sums.
By solving for the correct values, we get:


New_Die_B = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
This ensures the sum probabilities remain unchanged.
